## devonfw goes Open Source

devonfw is a platform which provides solutions to building business applications which combine best-in-class frameworks and libraries as well as industry proven practices and code conventions. devonfw is 100% Open Source (Apache License version 2.0) since the beginning of 2018. 

devonfw is build on OASP, the Open Application Standard Platform, also licensed under the Apache License. With the move to Open Source, devonfw will fully merge with OASP. This is a work in progress and far from complete. But we will be finalizing the merger in the months to come.
