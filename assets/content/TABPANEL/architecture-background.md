### An architecture that follows the most important principles 

* KISS Keep it small and simple
* Open. Commitment to open standards and solutions (no required dependencies to commercial or vendor-specific standards or solutions)
* Patterns. We concentrate on providing patterns, best-practices and examples rather than writing framework code.
* Solid. We pick solutions that are established and have been proven to be solid and robust in real-live (business) projects.
