### Architecture Patterns

Architectural patterns are a method of arranging blocks of functionality to address a need. Patterns can be used at the software, system, or enterprise levels. Pattern usage is an excellent way to reuse knowledge to address various problems. For example: in devonfw there is a clearly and cleanly defined Business component Architecture which divides the application into business components. The component part assigned to the logic layer contains the functional use-cases the business component is responsible for.
